NoteBridge — Clinical Note Navigation System

PROBLEM:-
Healthcare professionals generate large volumes of patient notes over time. Quickly locating relevant past information during consultations becomes difficult, leading to slower decision-making and reduced workflow efficiency.

GOAL:-
To build a Python-based system that enables clinicians to instantly access important historical notes by organizing records and highlighting relevant information.

KEY OBJECTIVE:-
Fast search of patient records
Structured, chronological note organization
Quick retrieval of critical history
Reduced time spent reviewing documentation

TARGET USERS:-
Doctors, clinical staff, and small healthcare centers.

CORE FEATURES:-
Patient-wise note storage
Timeline-based organization
Keyword search and smart highlighting
Rapid access to relevant past records

TECHNOLOGY STACK:-
Python Libraries: sqlite3, datetime, regex, basic NLP, tkinter/CLI.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:-
A lightweight clinical note navigation system that improves documentation access, supports faster consultations, and enhances continuity of care.

PROTOTYPE SCOPE:-

Focuses on storing notes, linking keywords, and retrieving relevant records to demonstrate intelligent navigation.
